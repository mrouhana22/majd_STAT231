### Q10

Include your answer and explanation here.  You can intersperse text with code in your explanation.

>  The variable `count_thousands` represents the number of babies born with the name "Joseph" per year per thousand babies. The variable `alive_prob` represents the probability each baby is alive today. `count_thousands*alive_prob` is the interaction between the variables `count_thousands` and `alive_prob`. When `count_thousands*alive_prob` is on the y-axis, the data values are shifted to the right. The original, trimodal graph with `count_thousands` on the y-axis is transformed into a bimodal graph once the interaction term is introduced. In addition, the median shifts over to the right as well. This happens because the probability of being alive increases as the year increases. Thus, the multiplication of the two variables results in the graph below.

```{r}
name_plot3 <- ggplot(data = joseph, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(y = count_thousands*alive_prob)
           , fill = "#b2d7e9", color = "white")

name_plot3
```

Once you're satisfied with your explanation:

- set the r code chunk option "include=FALSE" for the code chunk above (for the original code); we don't want to see all the original code in your answer and that option will suppress that code and output from being printed (but will still evaluate the code)
- delete the text and section header for the "# Original Code" section
- knit the document to pdf or html
- go to the "R Questions and Answers" forum on Moodle, and click on the discussion topic "Problem Set 1A Questions".  Click "Reply", indicate the question you're answering, and attach your knit file with the response
